# Who is behind this?  
Hello, my name is **Rafael**. My passion for video and photography was kindled in my childhood, growing up with my father's camera always within reach. This early exposure sparked my interest and led me to use my the first money I earned to pick up a camera at the age of 16.

Initially, I delved into the world of photography, where I've had the privilege of shooting cover images for a magazine. From there I moved onto events. My love for capturing moments also led me to become a concert and festival photographer, immortalizing the energy and vibrancy of these events through my lens.

Three years ago, I decided to expand my creative horizons and ventured into the realm of videography. Today, I specialize in creating engaging image and food videos, as well as crafting compelling aftermovies for festivals. Each project is a new opportunity for me to bring stories to life through the lens of my camera.
